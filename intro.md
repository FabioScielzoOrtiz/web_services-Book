# **Extracting and analyzing data from web-pages with Web-Services and Web-Scraping**

➡️ Objectives:

🔻 Obtain data from **Eurostat** and the **Statistical Institute of Catalonia** through their APIs (Web Services) and Web Scraping.

🔻 Analyse the extracted data descriptively.

➡️ Conclusions:

🔻 Being able to extract information from the Internet through APIs and Web Scraping are essential skills for any Data Scientist.

🔻 In some cases, when it is not possible to extract the desired information from a web page, either because they do not have an API for it, or they have one but the information is not accessible through it, Web Scraping becomes a good solution.
